# ML From Scratch

This repository contains my **from-scratch implementations of Machine Learning algorithms and utilities**, built purely for **learning and understanding**.

The goal is to reimplement the ML algorithms and helper functions that I use most often, without relying on high-level ML libraries, to better understand:
- the math behind the algorithms
- training and optimization
- how things work internally

This is **not a production library** and **not intended for real-world use**.

## What’s inside
- Common ML algorithms (implemented from scratch)
- Loss functions and optimization methods
- Basic data preprocessing and evaluation utilities

Built mainly using **Python + NumPy**, intentionally avoiding libraries like scikit-learn or PyTorch.

This repo is a **personal learning playground**.
